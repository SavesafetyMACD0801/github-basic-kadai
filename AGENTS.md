Plan to create a generative AI landing page with minimal styling:
1. Create a simple `index.html` in the repo root describing a generative AI product.
2. Sections should include: header, hero, product overview, product details, blog snippets, contact form, and footer with call to action.
3. Use minimal inline CSS for layout and basic colors. A small JavaScript snippet may handle form submission alerts.
4. Reference the existing screenshot image from `kadai_github/GitHubサンプル.png` in the hero section.
