Plan to create a generative AI landing page:
1. Create a simple `index.html` in the repo root describing a generative AI product.
2. The page should include sections laid out as: header, hero, product, product details, blog, contact form, and footer.
3. Keep content brief and emphasize features, benefits, and a call to action.
4. Use minimal styling with inline CSS for simplicity.
