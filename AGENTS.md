Plan to create a generative AI landing page:
1. Place `index.html` in the repository root written in Japanese.
2. Describe the generative AI product with sections for features, benefits, and a call-to-action form.
3. Display the screenshot `kadai_github/GitHubサンプル.png` on the page.
4. Keep styling minimal using inline CSS.
